-Documentation
-Make the init routine easier- there are ways to ask if a dictionary element exists so I can change to "does this exists and is it not None" instead of defining all the attributes I'll eventually use as None
-Get rid of the unmasked option
-Improve masking- either do a rotated rectangle or a footprint finder or something
-Check normalization for jackknife errors
-Change over to numpy read/write of normal text files



Check to see if the re-use of RR in the bootstrap calculation makes any difference.
