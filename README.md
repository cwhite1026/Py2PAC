## Py2PAC: Python 2-Point Angular Correlations  ##

This package was developed to calculate the galaxy angular two-point correlation functions on actual data.  It's under development and currently only contains the calculation of the angular correlation functions within a region of arbitrary outline with one depth.  The correlation functions may be calculated with error estimates via single galaxy bootstrapping, block bootstrapping, or jackknifing.  

### Current Status ###
I have a functioning version of the code, but it's a huge mess, so right now I'm working on cleaning things up, reorganizing, and optimizing some of the messier routines.  I should have a version of the code up in a month or so.
