IMPORTANT NOTE: This code does not function in its current state.  When I put things up on github, I decided that the code could use a little cleaning up and it ended up being a major reorganization.  The code is about 3/4 of the way through that reorganization.

## Py2PAC: Python 2-Point Angular Correlations  ##

This package was developed to calculate the galaxy angular two-point correlation functions on actual data.  It's under development and currently only contains the calculation of the angular correlation functions within a region of arbitrary outline with one depth.  The correlation functions may be calculated with error estimates via single galaxy bootstrapping, block bootstrapping, or jackknifing. 

### Current Status ###
I now have an alpha version of the clean(er) code with more documentation.  Still working on the image mask routines and adding more documentation into the code.  This version also still needs testing to make sure all the changes I made are functional.
