The AngularCatalog class
==================================

The AngularCatalog is the front-end for organizing and analyzing
observations.  The idea is that you give it all the information about
where the galaxies are and where the field is on the sky and it does
the rest.

**WARNING**:  This is the part of the code that doesn't work yet.  I
should have it up in the next week or two.
